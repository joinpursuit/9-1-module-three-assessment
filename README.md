- Write functional components in React making use of hooks like: useState, useEffect.
- Use props to customize components.
- Build complex component architectures that pass props downwards multiple levels.
- Set state on an individual component to modify that component’s presentation.
- Write an event handler that modifies state on user interaction.
- Build controlled forms that manage the state of the form.
